## 💡Motivation 

The motivation for creating this app lies in my commitment to fostering inclusive and respectful communication. Language shapes our perceptions and interactions, and we recognize the need to address its limitations and biases. By developing an app that enables word replacement based on a database, I aim to facilitate the adoption of more inclusive language practices.

The app offers an accessible and efficient solution to replace gender-specific terms, outdated stereotypes, and discriminatory language. By empowering individuals, content creators, educators, and organizations, I hope to inspire positive change and create a more harmonious world.

## 📲What it does?

- **Helps you write inclusively**: On pasting your message, the editor edits out the non-inclusive terms to a more inclusive term and highlights them for you.
- **Seamless copy paste**: Easy way to copy the inclusive message and paste it wherever you want!
- **List of words**: Provides an easy way to view the list of inclusive and non-inclusive words and to add more words.

## 🧠Challenges I ran into 

- Connecting MongoDB on a public wi-fi, which is why I ended up using Google sheets as a datasource


## 🥇Accomplishments we are proud of
- I was able to make what I conceptualized functionally and ✨IT WORKS✨

## 🚀Future Scope
- The UI can be improved further and a lot more screens and functionality can be added.
- Full CRUD ability can also be added

### Made with ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤 by Vidushi
